Modification of RODAM_3D's 180 Degree Hinges for the VzBot 235.

This version allows for the use of the Mellow 3D all aluminum motor mounts due to mounting hole being 5mm higher than the printed version.

You will need one of each STL file for a full set.

Full credit for the design goes to RODAM_3D. I just tweaked a few faces in Fusion so others dont have to repeat the work.
